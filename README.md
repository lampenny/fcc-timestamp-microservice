# Timestamp Microservice

As part of FreeCodeCamp's Backend Development and APIs course, I use their boilerplate code to build out a timestamp microservice.

## Getting started

 - clone this repo
 - run `yarn install`
 - now run `./node_modules/.bin/nodemon index.js` to start the app

 ##ã€€Endpoint

 It accepts a date string as a parameter and returns:

 `/api/:date`

```json
{ unix: 1451001600000, utc: "Fri, 25 Dec 2015 00:00:00 GMT" }
```
